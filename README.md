# Tkinter Tic-Tac-Toe!

Bet you've never seen anything like this program before - it's tic-tac-toe!

### Rules
* Win - There is no advanced algorithm behind the code or anything so you have no excuse.
    * To win - you have to get three marks in a row, column, or diagonally

## In all seriousness

I made this mainly as a way to practice using github and writing markdown files. In the code, I typically use the same kind of approach when making tkinter GUIs. I like it and think it's nice and organized, if you have any suggestions please let me know!
